To Run Home.html You need a HTML Editor. 
Please Note that the photos which you want to add should be named properly 
and add that name in the code home.html
I have used two photos ali.jpg as my main image and abc.jpg as background image
Note that you have to put those photos in the same folder where your html code is.
